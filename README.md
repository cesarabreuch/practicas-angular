You do not need to do this tutorial to understand those other examples. The Tour of Heroes tutorial is maintained here for context and continuity.

Hitos del proyecto:

- Use built-in Angular directives to show and hide elements and display lists of hero data.
- Create Angular components to display hero details and show an array of heroes.
- Use one-way data binding for read-only data.
- Add editable fields to update a model with two-way data binding.
- Bind component methods to user events, like keystrokes and clicks.
- Enable users to select a hero from a master list and edit that hero in the details view.
- Format data with pipes.
- Create a shared service to assemble the heroes.
- Use routing to navigate among different views and their components.
